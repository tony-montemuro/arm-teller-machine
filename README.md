# arm-teller-machine
For my CS 309 - Computer Organization &amp; Switching Theory class, this was the final ARM lab, in which we were instructed to create a program that functions as a Teller Machine. For more information, please check the rubric (Montemuro-Lab5-Rubric.pdf).

This program was written, compiled, and debugged on a Raspberry Pi Zero.
